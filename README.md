Optimizer for the synergy feature of WAMI (wizard and minion idle).

Currently can:

  -Maximize gains on one row, while keeping lower rows barely positive.
  
  -Try to have a "flat" or roughly equal distribution of gains/hour up to a given row.

Future goals:

  -Add in minimum tick optimization methods
  
  -Make sure that at higher amount of progress, the algorithms still work appropriately.
